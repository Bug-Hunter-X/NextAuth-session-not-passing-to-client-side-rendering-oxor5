# NextAuth Session Issue in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a problem with NextAuth session handling in Next.js 15. The session is correctly retrieved server-side but isn't properly passed to the client-side rendering, causing unexpected behavior. 

## Problem Description

The `about.js` file fetches a session using NextAuth's `unstable_getServerSession`.  While the session is correctly retrieved server-side, it's not being made available to the client during rendering. This leads to the client-side rendering failing to display session-dependent information correctly. 

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring the component to properly handle the session data and ensure it is accessible to the client during rendering. This often involves using appropriate methods for passing data from server-side functions to client-side components.  Check the `aboutSolution.js` file for the corrected code.
